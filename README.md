# A simple Pipe Mania copy made with Pixi.js

The main idea was to make this game feel cozy and less stressfull than the original is.

## created with:

-   Webpack
-   Typescript
-   Pixi.js

## what's implemented:

-   main menu,
-   random pipe queue generation,

-   timer,
-   checking path length,
-   checking max result
-   restarting game,
